<b>Observations<b>

1. Capomulin had the highest number of observations for the drug regimens at 230 observations followed by Ramicane at 228 observations. Propriva had the lowest number of observations at 156 observations. The decrease in the number of observations could have been caused by the mice in that group dying from the tumor before 45 days had passed. If this is the case, Capomulin and Ramicane would be a better drug for reducing the mass of a tumor in mice than Propriva because more mice lived longer while taking Capomulin and Ramicane than while taking Propriva

2. The average tumor mass (mm3) for mice in the Capomulin group was 40.676 and the average tumor mass (mm3) for the placebo group was 54.034. This means that Capomulin was more successful at reducing a tumor's mass than the placebo. The tumor mass for mouse l509 also decreased by 8 mm3 over the observation period demonstrating another way in which we can conclude that Capomulin was successful in reducing the mass of the mouse's tumor.
3. There is a strong positive correlation (0.84) between a mouse's weight (g) and tumor mass (mm3) meaning that there is a strong connection between a mouse's weight and the average tumor volume (mm3) of the mouse. This positive correlation means that as a mouse's weight (g) increases, the tumor mass also increases. However, we cannot draw the conclusion that a mouse's weight causes the higher average tumor volume or vice versa because correlation does not equal causation.
